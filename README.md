## Introduction

This is a classic memory game made up of 16 cards.
A pair of cards are flipped at a time. If they match, they will stay open. And if they don't match, they cards will be closed.

The timer starts *after* the first pair has been opened. Every pair of cards opened is counted as *one move*.

Rating star starts at 3, and it will drop to 2 stars after 11 moves, and one star after 15.

After the board has been cleared, a pop-up window will appear, showing the **star rating**, **total moves**, and **total time**.


#### A Udacity Project

The HTML and CSS is provided by Udacity. It displays a static version of the Memory Game project. The JavaScript contains a *shuffle* function.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
